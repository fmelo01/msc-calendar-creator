# Calendar Creator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Build the library

```bash
npm install --no-optional
ng build msc-calendar-creator
```

After building the project, the build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server

Since the library is listed as optional dependency, it's necessary run install command again to install it in the project's `node_modules` directory.

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the dev server.

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
